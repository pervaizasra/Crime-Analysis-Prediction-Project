# Crime-Analysis-Prediction-Project
**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project analyzes NYPD crime data to uncover patterns, understand victim demographics, explore weaponâ€“crime relationships, and build predictive models. It also includes an interactive Power BI dashboard for storytelling and decision support.

The project demonstrates data science + business intelligence skills with a strong social impact angle.

**ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**

- Explore crime trends and distributions across time, cities, and crime domains.

- Investigate victim demographics (age, gender) and their relation to crime.

- Analyze weapon usage across different crime domains.

- Build machine learning models to predict crime categories and weapon types.

- Create a Power BI dashboard to summarize findings for stakeholders.

  **ðŸ›  Methodology**

 ** 1.  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

        - Handled missing values (case closure dates, weapon info).

        - Feature engineering (age groups, case duration, case open/closed flag).

  **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

        - Crime frequency trends (monthly & daily).

         - Victim demographics vs. crime type.
     
         - Weapon usage distribution.

    **3. Machine Learning Models**

      - Random Forest classifier for crime domain prediction.

      - SMOTE applied to handle class imbalance.

      - Accuracy ~30â€“50% â†’ showing the complexity of real-world crime prediction.

   ** 4. Dashboard Development (Power BI)**

      - Executive Summary: KPIs & crime distribution.

      - Trends: Crimes per month/day & domain breakdown.

      - Victim Demographics: Gender & age vs. crime.

      - Weapon Analysis: Weapon vs. crime domain relationships.
**ðŸ“Š EDA & Model Results**
  **ðŸ”¹ Crime Distribution by Domain**

  **ðŸ”¹ Victim Demographics Heatmap**

  **ðŸ”¹ Model Performance**
**Metric	Value**
**Accuracy**	~0.30 (balanced dataset)
**F1-Score** (Other Crime)	0.43
Insight	Crime prediction is complex, but pipeline shows feature engineering + handling imbalance
